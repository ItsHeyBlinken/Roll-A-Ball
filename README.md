3D Roll-a-Ball Game
This is a simple 3D game built with Unity where the player controls a rolling ball to collect objects. The project demonstrates key game development concepts such as player movement, physics, collisions, and object interactions.

What I Learned

Implementing basic player controls.
Using Unity's physics system for movement.
Creating game mechanics like object collection and win conditions.
